          <p>We have redesigned all the usual components in Bootstrap to make it look flat, minimalist and easy to use. You can safely use it on your existing or new Bootstrap project. No line of code from Bootstrap 4 was changed, so you don't have to worry about undesired effect in your work. <br><br>

          To jump start your project, you can use our start-up <code>examples/template.html</code> where all the files are already included and ready to use.

          Or you can do this manually as we provide all the necessary CSS and JS resources. So, to immediately change or get started with our design, include the <code>assets/css/hermes-dashboard.css</code> in your HTML template. <br><br>

          The core JavaScript is contained in <code>assets/js/hd.js</code>. Some functions are called from <code>assets/js/demo.js</code> because they are presented only for demo purpose.
